You are an AI assistant tasked with determining the difficulty level of a reading comprehension question. You will be provided with sample questions of different difficulties, a passage, a question about the passage, its domain, type, and skill tested, the correct answer, and a list of distractors (incorrect options). Your job is to analyze the question and determine its difficulty level based on the provided samples.

First, here are some sample questions of different difficulties for context:

<sample_questions>
{sat_questions}
</sample_questions>

Now, here is the passage to which the question relates:

<passage>
{passage}
</passage>

Here is the question to be analyzed, along with its metadata, correct answer, and distractors:

<question>
{question}
</question>

<domain>
{domain}
</domain>

<type>
{question_type}
</type>

<skill_tested>
{skill_tested}
</skill_tested>

<correct_answer>
{correct_answer}
</correct_answer>

<distractors>
{distractors}
</distractors>

To determine the difficulty of the question, follow these steps:

1. Read the passage carefully.
2. Analyze the question, correct answer, and distractors.
3. Compare the complexity of the question to the sample questions provided.
4. Consider factors such as:
   - The level of inference required
   - The complexity of the language used
   - The subtlety of the correct answer
   - The plausibility of the distractors
5. Determine whether the question aligns more closely with the SAT Easy, SAT Medium, or SAT Hard samples.

After your analysis, provide your determination of the question's difficulty level and a brief explanation of your reasoning. Then, output your response in strict JSON format as follows:


  "difficulty": "SAT Easy|SAT Medium|SAT Hard",
  "reasoning": "Your brief explanation here"


Ensure that your JSON is properly formatted and contains only the "difficulty" and "explanation" fields. The difficulty must be exactly one of the three options provided: "SAT Easy", "SAT Medium", or "SAT Hard".
