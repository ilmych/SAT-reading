You will be given a passage, a question about the passage, the correct answer to the question, and a list of distractors (incorrect options). Your task is to determine if the correct answer is significantly longer or shorter than the distractors and assign a score accordingly.

Here are the inputs:

<question>
{question}
</question>

<correct_answer>
{correct_answer}
</correct_answer>

<distractors>
{distractors}
</distractors>

Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the length of the correct answer and each distractor. Count the number of words and characters in each.

2. Calculate the average length of the distractors.

3. Compare the length of the correct answer to the average length of the distractors. Consider the correct answer "significantly" longer or shorter if it differs from the average distractor length by more than 30%.

4. Assign a score based on your analysis:
   - If the correct answer is significantly longer or shorter than the distractors, assign a score of 0.
   - If the correct answer is similar in length to the distractors (within 30% of the average), assign a score of 1.

5. Provide your reasoning and the score in a strict JSON format. Use the following structure:

{{
  "score": 0 or 1,
  "reasoning": "Your explanation here"
}}

Ensure that your output is valid JSON. Do not include any text outside of the JSON structure.
