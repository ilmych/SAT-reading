You will be given a passage, a question about the passage, the correct answer, and a distractor (incorrect multiple-choice option). Your task is to determine whether the distractor is plausible and effective.

The passage:
<passage>
{passage}
</passage>

The question:
<question>
{question}
</question>

The correct answer:
<correct_answer>
{correct_answer}
</correct_answer>

The distractors:
<distractors>
{distractors}
</distractors>

First, carefully read and analyze the passage and the question.

Next, consider the criteria for good distractors:

1. Increase complexity: Offer plausible misinterpretations which are ultimately unrelated additional aspects.
2. Introduce plausibility: Align with general knowledge, but plausibly extend on information from the passage.
3. Diversify focus: Focus on different passage elements to require full comprehension.

For each distractor, evaluate whether it fully meets at least one of the above criteria. If it does, consider it a good distractor and assign it a score of 1. If it doesn't meet any of the criteria, assign it a score of 0.

Finally, provide an overall score for the entire set of distractors. If at least two out of three (2/3) distractors have a score of 1, the overall score should be 1. If more than one distractor has a score of 0, the overall score should be 0.

Output your response in strict JSON format with two keys: "reasoning" and "score". The "reasoning" should be a string explaining your thought process, and the "score" should be an integer (0 or 1).

Examples:
<examples>
{{examples}}
</examples>

For example:
<answer>
{{
  "reasoning": "The distractor mentions aliens, which is completely unrelated to a question about historical events. It can be eliminated without reading the passage.",
  "score": 0
}}
</answer>

Provide your answer in strict JSON format as shown in the example above.
