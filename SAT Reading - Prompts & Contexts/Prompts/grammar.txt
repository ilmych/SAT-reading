You will be given a passage of text and a question about that passage with multiple choice options. Your task is to scrutinize the question fully for grammatical or formatting inconsistencies or errors.

The passage:
<passage>
{passage}
</passage>

The question:
<question>
{question}
</question>

The correct answer:
<correct_answer>
{correct_answer}
</correct_answer>

The incorrect options (distractors):
<distractors>
{distractors}
</distractors>

1. Carefully examine the question and each of the options (correct answer and three distractors) for any grammatical or formatting errors. This includes:
   - Spelling mistakes
   - Punctuation errors
   - Capitalization issues
   - Sentence structure problems
   - Formatting inconsistencies (e.g., improper use of spaces, line breaks, etc.)
2. Important: Do not consider any text that is directly quoted from the passage when evaluating the question's grammar or formatting. Quotes from the passage should be ignored in your assessment.
3. If you find any grammatical or formatting errors in the question (excluding quoted text from the passage), you should give the question a score of 0.
4. If the question is free from grammatical and formatting errors (excluding quoted text), you should give the question a score of 1.
5. Provide your output in strict JSON format as follows:
{{
 "score": 0 or 1,
 "reasoning": "Your explanation here"
}}
