You will be given a passage and a question. Your task is to determine whether the question is related to the content of the passage.

The passage:
<passage>
{passage}
</passage>

The question:
<question>
{question}
</question>

1. Analyze the relevance of the question to the passage:
   - Identify the main topics, entities, or concepts mentioned in the passage.
   - Compare these to the content of the question.
   - Determine if the question can be answered using information from the passage or if it's closely related to the passage's subject matter. If yes, give it a score of 1.
   - If the question is only tangentially related or completely unrelated, give it a score of 0.

2. Provide your analysis and decision in the following JSON format:

     "score": 0 or 1,
     "reasoning": "Your explanation here",


   Where:
   - "score" is 1 if the question is related to the passage, 0 if it's not.
   - "explanation" is a brief justification for your decision.

Ensure that your output is valid JSON. Remember to enclose your entire JSON output within <answer> tags.
