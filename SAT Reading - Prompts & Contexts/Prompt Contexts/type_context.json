    "sample_question1": "To dye wool, Navajo (Diné) weaver Lillie Taylor uses plants and vegetables from Arizona, where she lives. For example, she achieved the deep reds and browns featured in her 2003 rug In the Path of the Four Seasons by using Arizona dock roots, drying and grinding them before mixing the powder with water to create a dye bath. To intensify the appearance of certain colors, Taylor also sometimes mixes in clay obtained from nearby soil. Which choice best states the main idea of the text? A) Reds and browns are not commonly featured in most of Taylor’s rugs. B) In the Path of the Four Seasons is widely acclaimed for its many colors and innovative weaving techniques. C) Taylor draws on local resources in the approach she uses to dye wool. D) Taylor finds it difficult to locate Arizona dock root in the desert.",
    "sample_question2": "Some animal-behavior studies involve observing wild animals in their natural habitat, and some involve capturing wild animals and observing them in a laboratory. Each approach has advantages over the other. In wild studies, researchers can more easily presume that the animals are behaving normally, and in lab studies, researchers can more easily control factors that might affect the results. But if, for example, the results from a wild study and a lab study of Western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) contradict each other, one or both of the studies must have failed to account for some factor that was relevant to the birds’ behavior. Which choice best states the main idea of the text? A) When the results of a natural-habitat study and those from a lab study of a wild animal such as the Western scrub-jay conflict, the study in the natural habitat is more likely than the lab study to have accurate results. B) Studying wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay in both their natural habitat and lab settings is likely to yield conflicting results that researchers cannot fully resolve. C) Wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay can be effectively studied in their natural habitat and in the lab, but each approach has drawbacks that could affect the accuracy of the findings. D) Differing results between natural-habitat and lab studies of wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay are a strong indication that both of the studies had design flaws that affected the accuracy of their results.",
    "sample_question3": "The recovery of a 1,000-year-old Chinese shipwreck in the Java Sea near present-day Indonesia has yielded a treasure trove of artifacts, including thousands of small ceramic bowls. Using a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer tool, Lisa Niziolek and her team were able to detect the chemical composition of these bowls without damaging them. By comparing the chemical signatures of the bowls with those of the materials still at old Chinese kiln sites, Niziolek and her team can pinpoint which Chinese kilns likely produced the ceramic bowls. Which choice best states the main idea of the text? A) Because of a new technology, researchers can locate and recover more shipwrecks than they could in the past. B) Researchers have been able to identify the location of a number of Chinese kilns in operation 1,000 years ago. C) With the help of a special tool, researchers have determined the likely origin of bowls recovered from a shipwreck. D) Before the invention of portable X-ray fluorescence, researchers needed to take a small piece out of an artifact to analyze its components."

    "sample_question1": "To make her art more widely available, graphic artist Elizabeth Catlett turned to linocuts. In linocut printing, an artist carves an image into a sheet of linoleum to create a stamp that is used to mass-produce prints. In the linocut series The Black Woman (1946–1947), Catlett depicts the everyday experiences of Black women alongside the achievements of well-known Black women. This pairing invites the viewer to draw connections among the women. The linocut process enabled Catlett’s work to reach a wide audience and supported her aim to unite Black women through her art. According to the text, what is significant about Catlett’s use of linocut printing? A) Linocut printing involved using materials that were readily available to Catlett. B) Linocut printing helped Catlett use art to connect people, especially Black women. C) Catlett became commercially successful once she started using linocut printing. D)Catlett was one of the first Black artists to use linocut printing.",
    "sample_question2": "In 2022, researchers rediscovered ancient indigenous glyphs, or drawings, on the walls of a cave in Alabama. The cave’s ceiling was only a few feet high, affording no position from which the glyphs, being as wide as ten feet, could be viewed or photographed in their entirety. However, the researchers used a technique called photogrammetry to assemble numerous photos of the walls into a 3D model. They then worked with representatives of tribes originally from the region, including the Chickasaw Nation, to understand the significance of the animal and humanoid figures adorning the cave. According to the text, what challenge did the researchers have to overcome to examine the glyphs? A) The cave was so remote that the researchers couldn’t easily reach it. B) Some of the glyphs were so faint that they couldn’t be photographed. C) The researchers were unable to create a 3D model of the cave. D) The cave’s dimensions prevented the researchers from fully viewing the glyphs.",
    "sample_question3": "For many years, the only existing fossil evidence of mixopterid eurypterids—an extinct family of large aquatic arthropods known as sea scorpions and related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs—came from four species living on the paleocontinent of Laurussia. In a discovery that expands our understanding of the geographical distribution of mixopterids, paleontologist Bo Wang and others have identified fossilized remains of a new mixopterid species, Terropterus xiushanensis, that lived over 400 million years ago on the paleocontinent of Gondwana. According to the text, why was Wang and his team’s discovery of the Terropterus xiushanensis fossil significant? A) The fossil constitutes the first evidence found by scientists that mixopterids lived more than 400 million years ago. B) The fossil helps establish that mixopterids are more closely related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs than previously thought. C) The fossil helps establish a more accurate timeline of the evolution of mixopterids on the paleocontinents of Laurussia and Gondwana. D) The fossil constitutes the first evidence found by scientists that mixopterids existed outside the paleocontinent of Laurussia."

    "sample_question1": "Algae living within the tissues of corals play a critical role in keeping corals, and the marine ecosystems they are part of, thriving. Some coral species appear brown in color when healthy due to the algae colonies living in their tissues. In the event of an environmental stressor, the algae can die or be expelled, causing the corals to appear white. To recover the algae, the bleached corals then begin to produce bright colors, which block intense sunlight, encouraging the light-sensitive algae to recolonize the corals. What does the text most strongly suggest about corals that produce bright colors? A) These corals have likely been subjected to stressful environmental conditions. B) These corals are likely more vulnerable to exposure from intense sunlight than white corals are. C) These corals have likely recovered from an environmental event without the assistance of algae colonies. D) These corals are more likely to survive without algae colonies than brown corals are.",
    "sample_question2": "Disco remains one of the most ridiculed popular music genres of the late twentieth century. But as scholars have argued, the genre is far less superficial than many people believe. Take the case of disco icon Donna Summer: she may have been associated with popular songs about love and heartbreak (subjects hardly unique to disco, by the way), but like many Black women singers before her, much of her music also reflects concerns about community and identity. These concerns are present in many of the genre’s greatest songs, and they generally don’t require much digging to reveal. What does the text most strongly suggest about the disco genre? A) It has been unjustly ignored by most scholars despite the importance of the themes addressed by many of the genre’s songs. B) It evolved over time from a superficial genre focused on romance to a genre focused on more serious concerns. C) It has been unfairly dismissed for the inclusion of subject matter that is also found in other musical genres. D) It gave rise to a Black women’s musical tradition that has endured even though the genre itself faded in the late twentieth century.",
    "sample_question3": "The most recent iteration of the immersive theater experience Sleep No More, which premiered in New York City in 2011, transforms its performance space—a five-story warehouse—into a 1930s-era hotel. Audience members, who wander through the labyrinthine venue at their own pace and follow the actors as they play out simultaneous, interweaving narrative loops, confront the impossibility of experiencing the production in its entirety. The play’s refusal of narrative coherence thus hinges on the sense of spatial fragmentation that the venue’s immense and intricate layout generates. What does the text most strongly suggest about Sleep No More’s use of its performance space?  A) The choice of a New York City venue likely enabled the play’s creators to experiment with the use of theatrical space in a way that venues from earlier productions could not. B) Audience members likely find the experience of the play disappointing because they generally cannot make their way through the entire venue. C) The production’s dependence on a particular performance environment would likely make it difficult to reproduce exactly in a different theatrical space. D) Audience members who navigate the space according to a recommended itinerary will likely have a better grasp of the play’s narrative than audience members who depart from that itinerary."

Man could but little proffer in exchange  Save that his cages have a larger range.  That lion with his lordly, untamed heart  Has in some man his human counterpart, Some lofty soul in dreams and visions wrapped,  But in the stifling flesh securely trapped. Based on the text, what challenge do humans sometimes experience? A) They cannot effectively tame certain wild animals because of a lack of compassion. B) They cannot focus on setting attainable goals because of a lack of motivation. C) They quickly become frustrated when faced with difficult tasks because of a lack of self-control.

    "sample_question2": "Cats can judge unseen people’s positions in space by the sound of their voices and thus react with surprise when the same person calls to them from two different locations in a short span of time. Saho Takagi and colleagues reached this conclusion by measuring cats’ levels of surprise based on their ear and head movements while the cats heard recordings of their owners’ voices from two speakers spaced far apart. Cats exhibited a low level of surprise when owners’ voices were played twice from the same speaker, but they showed a high level of surprise when the voice was played once each from the two different speakers. According to the text, how did the researchers determine the level of surprise displayed by the cats in the study? A) They watched how each cat moved its ears and head. B) They examined how each cat reacted to the voice of a stranger. C) They studied how each cat physically interacted with its owner. D) They tracked how each cat moved around the room.",

    "sample_question2": "Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt have argued that experiencing awe—a sensation of reverence and wonder typically brought on by perceiving something grand or powerful—can enable us to feel more connected to others and thereby inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby. Which finding from the researchers’ study, if true, would most strongly support their claim? A) Participants who had been looking at the trees helped the experimenter pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had been looking at the building. B) Participants who helped the experimenter pick up the pens used a greater number of positive words to describe the trees and the building in a postexperiment survey than did participants who did not help the experimenter. C) Participants who did not help the experimenter pick up the pens were significantly more likely to report having experienced a feeling of awe, regardless of whether they looked at the building or the trees. D) Participants who had been looking at the building were significantly more likely to notice that the experimenter had dropped the pens than were participants who had been looking at the trees.",
    "sample_question3": "Icebergs generally appear to be mostly white or blue, depending on how the ice reflects sunlight. Ice with air bubbles trapped in it looks white because much of the light reflects off the bubbles. Ice without air bubbles usually looks blue because the light travels deep into the ice and only a little of it is reflected. However, some icebergs in the sea around Antarctica appear to be green. One team of scientists hypothesized that this phenomenon is the result of yellow-tinted dissolved organic carbon in Antarctic waters mixing with blue ice to produce the color green. Which finding, if true, would most directly weaken the team’s hypothesis? A) White ice doesn’t change color when mixed with dissolved organic carbon due to the air bubbles in the ice. B) Dissolved organic carbon has a stronger yellow color in Antarctic waters than it does in other places. C) Blue icebergs and green icebergs are rarely found near each other. D) Blue icebergs and green icebergs contain similarly small traces of dissolved organic carbon."

They found that when attempting to mimic grid cells (brain cells used in navigation), while 90% of the networks could accomplish navigation-related tasks, only about 10% of those exhibited any behaviors similar to those of grid cells. <u>But even this approximation of grid-cell activity has less to do with similarity between the neural networks and biological brains than it does with the rules programmed into the networks.</u> Which finding, if true, would most directly support the claim in the underlined sentence? A) The rules that allow for networks to exhibit behaviors like those of grid cells have no equivalent in the function of biological brains. B) The networks that do not exhibit behaviors like those of grid cells were nonetheless programmed with rules that had proven useful in earlier neural-network studies. C) Neural networks can often accomplish tasks that biological brains do, but they are typically programmed with rules to model multiple types of brain cells simultaneously. D) Once a neural network is programmed, it is trained on certain tasks to see if it can independently arrive at processes that are similar to those performed by biological brains.",

    "sample_question3": "It’s common for jazz musicians and fans to refer to certain songs as having “swing,” indicating that the songs provoke a strong feeling, like the impulse to tap one’s foot or dance. The exact acoustic properties that give a song swing, however, have long been thought to be undefinable. To investigate swing, a team led by physicist Corentin Nelias delayed the downbeats and synchronized the offbeats in jazz piano solos and asked jazz musicians to compare the intensity of swing in each modified piece with the intensity of swing in the original piece. They found that participants were more than seven times likelier to characterize the modified songs as having swing than to characterize the original versions as having swing, suggesting that ______ Which choice most logically completes the text? A) synchronized offbeats tend to give a song swing regardless of whether downbeats are delayed. B) the acoustic properties that give a song swing are not easy for jazz musicians to manipulate. C) jazz songs that feature the piano are more likely to have swing than are jazz songs that do not feature the piano. D) the timing of downbeats and offbeats may play a crucial role in giving a song swing."

A case in point: In a 2014 study, Megan O’Brien and Alaa Ahmed had subjects stand or sit while making risky simulated economic decisions. Standing is more physically unstable and cognitively demanding than sitting; accordingly, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that standing subjects would display more risk aversion during the decision-making tasks than sitting subjects did, since they would want to avoid further feelings of discomfort and complicated risk evaluations. But O’Brien and Ahmed actually found no difference in the groups’ performance. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

    "sample_question3": "In many agricultural environments, the banks of streams are kept forested to protect water quality, but it’s been unclear what effects these forests may have on stream biodiversity. To investigate the issue, biologist Xingli Giam and colleagues studied an Indonesian oil palm plantation, comparing the species richness of forested streams with that of nonforested streams. Giam and colleagues found that species richness was significantly higher in forested streams, a finding the researchers attribute to the role leaf litter plays in sheltering fish from predators and providing food resources. Which choice best states the main purpose of the text? A) It discusses research intended to settle a debate about how agricultural yields can be increased without negative effects on water quality.   B) It explains the differences between stream-protection strategies used in oil palm plantations and stream-protection strategies used in other kinds of agricultural environments.

    "sample_question3": "According to Indian economist and sociologist Radhakamal Mukerjee (1889–1968), the Eurocentric concepts that informed early twentieth-century social scientific methods—for example, the idea that all social relations are reducible to struggles between individuals—had little relevance for India.

    "sample_question1": "Text 1 What factors influence the abundance of species in a given ecological community? Some theorists have argued that historical diversity is a major driver of how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes: differences in community diversity across otherwise similar habitats, in this view, are strongly affected by the number of species living in those habitats at earlier times. Text 2 In 2010, a group of researchers including biologist Carla Cáceres created artificial pools in a New York forest. They stocked some pools with a diverse mix of zooplankton species and others with a single zooplankton species and allowed the pool communities to develop naturally thereafter. Over the course of four years, Cáceres and colleagues periodically measured the species diversity of the pools, finding—contrary to their expectations—that by the end of the study there was little to no difference in the pools’ species diversity. Based on the texts, how would Cáceres and colleagues (Text 2) most likely describe the view of the theorists presented in Text 1? A) It is largely correct, but it requires a minor refinement in light of the research team’s results.

    "sample_question2": "Text 1 Films and television shows commonly include a long list of credits naming the people involved in a production. Credit sequences may not be exciting, but they generally ensure that everyone’s contributions are duly acknowledged. Because they are highly standardized, film and television credits are also valuable to anyone researching the careers of pioneering cast and crew members who have worked in the mediums. Text 2 Video game scholars face a major challenge in the industry’s failure to consistently credit the artists, designers, and other contributors involved in making video games. Without a reliable record of which people worked on which games, questions about the medium’s development can be difficult to answer, and the accomplishments of all but its best-known innovators can be difficult to trace. Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most likely respond to the discussion in Text 2? A) By recommending that the scholars mentioned in Text 2 consider employing the methods regularly used by film and television researchers B) By pointing out that credits have a different intended purpose in film and television than in the medium addressed by the scholars mentioned in Text 2 C) By suggesting that the scholars mentioned in Text 2 rely more heavily on credits as a source of information than film and television researchers do D) By observing that a widespread practice in film and television largely prevents the kind of problem faced by the scholars mentioned in Text 2",
    "sample_question3": "Text 1 Soy sauce, made from fermented soybeans, is noted for its umami flavor. Umami—one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, bitter, salty, and sour—was formally classified when its taste receptors were discovered in the 2000s. In 2007, to define the pure umami flavor scientists Rie Ishii and Michael O’Mahony used broths made from shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed, and two panels of Japanese and US judges closely agreed on a description of the taste. Text 2 A 2022 experiment by Manon Jünger et al. led to a greater understanding of soy sauce’s flavor profile. The team initially presented a mixture of compounds with low molecular weights to taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as real soy sauce. Further analysis of soy sauce identified proteins, including dipeptides, that enhanced umami flavor and also contributed to saltiness. The team then made a mix of 50 chemical compounds that re-created soy sauce’s flavor. Based on the texts, if Ishii and O’Mahony (Text 1) and Jünger et al. (Text 2) were aware of the findings of both experiments, they would most likely agree with which statement? A) On average, the diets of people in the United States tend to have fewer foods that contain certain dipeptides than the diets of people in Japan have. B) Chemical compounds that activate both the umami and salty taste receptors tend to have a higher molecular weight than those that only activate umami taste receptors. C) Fermentation introduces proteins responsible for the increase of umami flavor in soy sauce, and those proteins also increase the perception of saltiness. D) The broths in the 2007 experiment most likely did not have a substantial amount of the dipeptides that played a key part in the 2022 experiment."
