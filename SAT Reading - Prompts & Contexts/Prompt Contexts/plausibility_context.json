"passage": "<p>The circus arrives without warning.</p><p>No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.</p><p>The towering tents are striped in white and black, no golds and crimsons to be seen. No color at all, save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the surrounding fields. Black-and-white stripes on grey sky; countless tents of varying shapes and sizes, with an elaborate wrought-iron fence encasing them in a colorless world. Even what little ground is visible from outside is black or white, painted or powdered, or treated with some other circus trick.</p><p>But it is not open for business. Not just yet.</p><p>Within hours everyone in town has heard about it. By afternoon news has spread several towns over. Word of mouth is a more effective method of advertisement than typeset words and exclamation points on paper pamphlets or posters. It is impressive and unusual news, the sudden appearance of a mysterious circus. People marvel at the staggering height of the tallest tents. They stare at the clock that sits just inside the gates that no one can properly describe.</p><p>And the black sign painted in white letters that hangs upon the gates, the one that reads:</p><p class:\"”text-center”\"><em>Opens at Nightfall<br/>Closes at Dawn</em></p><p>“What kind of circus is only open at night?” people ask. No one has a proper answer, yet as dusk approaches there is a substantial crowd of spectators gathering outside the gates.</p><p>You are amongst them, of course. Your curiosity got the better of you, as curiosity is wont to do. You stand in the fading light, the scarf around your neck pulled up against the chilly evening breeze, waiting to see for yourself exactly what kind of circus only opens once the sun sets.</p><p>The ticket booth clearly visible behind the gates is closed and barred. The tents are still, save for when they ripple ever so slightly in the wind. The only movement within the circus is the clock that ticks by the passing minutes, if such a wonder of sculpture can even be called a clock.</p><p>The circus looks abandoned and empty. But you think perhaps you can smell caramel wafting through the evening breeze, beneath the crisp scent of the autumn leaves. A subtle sweetness at the edges of the cold.</p><p>The sun disappears completely beyond the horizon, and the remaining luminosity shifts from dusk to twilight. The people around you are growing restless from waiting, a sea of shuffling feet, murmuring about abandoning the endeavor in search of someplace warmer to pass the evening. You yourself are debating departing when it happens.</p><p>First, there is a popping sound. It is barely audible over the wind and conversation. A soft noise like a kettle about to boil for tea. Then comes the light.</p><p>All over the tents, small lights begin to flicker, as though the entirety of the circus is covered in particularly bright fireflies. The waiting crowd quiets as it watches this display of illumination. Someone near you gasps. A small child claps his hands with glee at the sight.</p><p>When the tents are all aglow, sparkling against the night sky, the sign appears.</p><p>Stretched across the top of the gates, hidden in curls of iron, more firefly-like lights flicker to life. They pop as they brighten, some accompanied by a shower of glowing white sparks and a bit of smoke. The people nearest to the gates take a few steps back.</p><p>At first, it is only a random pattern of lights. But as more of them ignite, it becomes clear that they are aligned in scripted letters. First a <em>C</em> is distinguishable, followed by more letters. A <em>q</em>, oddly, and several <em>e’</em>s. When the final bulb pops alight, and the smoke and sparks dissipate, it is finally legible, this elaborate incandescent sign. Leaning to your left to gain a better view, you can see that it reads:</p><p class:\"”text-center”\"><em>Le Cirque des Rêves</em></p><p>Some in the crowd smile knowingly, while others frown and look questioningly at their neighbors. A child near you tugs on her mother’s sleeve, begging to know what it says.</p><p>“The Circus of Dreams,” comes the reply. The girl smiles delightedly.</p><p>Then the iron gates shudder and unlock, seemingly by their own volition. They swing outward, inviting the crowd inside.</p><p>Now the circus is open.</p><p>Now you may enter. </p>",
"question": "In the passage, the author describes the mysterious nature of the circus's arrival. Which quotation from the text most effectively illustrates this claim?",
"correct_answer": "'No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.'",
"distractors": ["'Within hours everyone in town has heard about it. By afternoon news has spread several towns over.'", "'The towering tents are striped in white and black, no golds and crimsons to be seen.'", "'The circus arrives without warning.'"]},
"A":
{ "reasoning": "Distractor 1: 'Within hours everyone in town has heard about it. By afternoon news has spread several towns over.' This distractor is plausible as it relates to the circus's arrival, but it focuses on the aftermath rather than the mysterious nature of the arrival itself. It meets the criterion of diversifying focus.\n\nDistractor 2: 'The towering tents are striped in white and black, no golds and crimsons to be seen.' This distractor describes the appearance of the circus rather than its arrival, and doesn't address the mysterious nature of its appearance. It doesn't meet any of the criteria for a good distractor in this context.\n\nDistractor 3: 'The circus arrives without warning.' This distractor is actually the opening line of the passage and directly relates to the mysterious nature of the circus's arrival. However, it's too brief and doesn't provide as much detail as the correct answer. It meets the criterion of introducing plausibility.\n\nOverall, two out of three distractors (1 and 3) meet at least one criterion for good distractors, while one (2) does not. This makes the set of distractors partially effective, but not fully.", "score": 1 }

"passage" : "Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt have argued that experiencing awe—a sensation of reverence and wonder typically brought on by perceiving something grand or powerful—can enable us to feel more connected to others and thereby inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.",
"question" : "Which finding from the researchers’ study, if true, would most strongly support their claim?",
"correct_answer" : "Participants who had been looking at the trees helped the experimenter pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had been looking at the building.",
"distractors" : ["Participants who helped the experimenter pick up the pens used a greater number of positive words to describe the trees and the building in a postexperiment survey than did participants who did not help the experimenter.", "Participants who did not help the experimenter pick up the pens were significantly more likely to report having experienced a feeling of awe, regardless of whether they looked at the building or the trees.", "Participants who had been looking at the building were significantly more likely to notice that the experimenter had dropped the pens than were participants who had been looking at the trees."]},
"A":
{ "reasoning": "Distractor 1 increases complexity by introducing a plausible misinterpretation related to positive word usage, which is not directly related to the main claim about altruistic behavior. Distractor 2 introduces plausibility by mentioning the experience of awe, which is relevant to the passage, but contradicts the researchers' claim in a way that requires careful consideration. Distractor 3 diversifies focus by shifting attention to the participants' awareness of the dropped pens, which is related to the experiment but not directly supportive of the main claim. All three distractors meet at least one criterion for good distractors, making them effective in challenging test-takers to carefully analyze the passage and question.", "score": 1 }

"question" : "Based on the text, the author suggests that the new Michigan graduation requirements ______. Which choice most logically completes the text?",
"correct_answer" : "may increase dropout rates",
"distractors" : ["will better prepare students for vocational jobs", "are impractical for all students", "will lead to a shortage of vocational workers"]},
"A":
{"reasoning": "1. 'will better prepare students for vocational jobs': This directly contradicts the author's argument that advanced math and science classes are unnecessary for vocational jobs. It doesn't meet any of the criteria for a good distractor. 2. 'are impractical for all students': While this aligns with the author's overall argument, it's too extreme. The author suggests the requirements are excessive for vocational students, not all students. It doesn't fully meet any of the criteria. 3. 'will lead to a shortage of vocational workers': This is a plausible extension of the author's concerns, particularly the worry about increased dropout rates. It meets criterion 2 by introducing plausibility. Hence, the score is 0, since two out of three distractors fail to meet the criteria.", "score": 0}

"passage" : "NASA’s Aspera mission, led by Carlos Vargas, will investigate the circumgalactic medium (CGM), the huge swaths of low-density gas that fill and surround galaxies. Specifically, the team will focus on portions of the gas that exist in a “warm-hot” phase: these portions haven’t previously been observable but are thought to fuel new star formation and hold most of the mass that makes up a galaxy. Using a telescope capable of revealing these parts of the CGM, the Aspera mission should help answer long-standing questions about how galaxies emerge, change, and even interact.",
"question" : "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",

"A":
{ "reasoning": "Distractor 1 introduces plausibility by mentioning Vargas as the leader of the Aspera mission, which is true, but incorrectly states he'll be the first to investigate the CGM. This aligns with criterion 2. Distractor 2 increases complexity by adding information about previous studies of galaxies surrounded by CGM, meeting criterion 1. Distractor 3 diversifies focus by mentioning galaxy interaction, which is briefly mentioned in the passage but not central to the main idea, satisfying criterion 3.

"passage" : "In many agricultural environments, the banks of streams are kept forested to protect water quality, but it’s been unclear what effects these forests may have on stream biodiversity. To investigate the issue, biologist Xingli Giam and colleagues studied an Indonesian oil palm plantation, comparing the species richness of forested streams with that of nonforested streams. Giam and colleagues found that species richness was significantly higher in forested streams, a finding the researchers attribute to the role leaf litter plays in sheltering fish from predators and providing food resources.",

The second distractor, 'They create a balanced approach between academic and vocational education,' is also inconsistent with the passage, which argues that the new requirements prioritize academic subjects at the expense of vocational training. The third distractor, 'They focus on enhancing vocational training opportunities,' is completely opposite to the main argument of the passage. None of these distractors introduce plausible misinterpretations or align with the information presented in the text.
