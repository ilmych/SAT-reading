"passage": "<p>The circus arrives without warning.</p><p>No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.</p><p>The towering tents are striped in white and black, no golds and crimsons to be seen. No color at all, save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the surrounding fields. Black-and-white stripes on grey sky; countless tents of varying shapes and sizes, with an elaborate wrought-iron fence encasing them in a colorless world. Even what little ground is visible from outside is black or white, painted or powdered, or treated with some other circus trick.</p><p>But it is not open for business. Not just yet.</p><p>Within hours everyone in town has heard about it. By afternoon news has spread several towns over. Word of mouth is a more effective method of advertisement than typeset words and exclamation points on paper pamphlets or posters. It is impressive and unusual news, the sudden appearance of a mysterious circus. People marvel at the staggering height of the tallest tents. They stare at the clock that sits just inside the gates that no one can properly describe.</p><p>And the black sign painted in white letters that hangs upon the gates, the one that reads:</p><p class:\"”text-center”\"><em>Opens at Nightfall<br/>Closes at Dawn</em></p><p>“What kind of circus is only open at night?” people ask. No one has a proper answer, yet as dusk approaches there is a substantial crowd of spectators gathering outside the gates.</p><p>You are amongst them, of course. Your curiosity got the better of you, as curiosity is wont to do. You stand in the fading light, the scarf around your neck pulled up against the chilly evening breeze, waiting to see for yourself exactly what kind of circus only opens once the sun sets.</p><p>The ticket booth clearly visible behind the gates is closed and barred. The tents are still, save for when they ripple ever so slightly in the wind. The only movement within the circus is the clock that ticks by the passing minutes, if such a wonder of sculpture can even be called a clock.</p><p>The circus looks abandoned and empty. But you think perhaps you can smell caramel wafting through the evening breeze, beneath the crisp scent of the autumn leaves. A subtle sweetness at the edges of the cold.</p><p>The sun disappears completely beyond the horizon, and the remaining luminosity shifts from dusk to twilight. The people around you are growing restless from waiting, a sea of shuffling feet, murmuring about abandoning the endeavor in search of someplace warmer to pass the evening. You yourself are debating departing when it happens.</p><p>First, there is a popping sound. It is barely audible over the wind and conversation. A soft noise like a kettle about to boil for tea. Then comes the light.</p><p>All over the tents, small lights begin to flicker, as though the entirety of the circus is covered in particularly bright fireflies. The waiting crowd quiets as it watches this display of illumination. Someone near you gasps. A small child claps his hands with glee at the sight.</p><p>When the tents are all aglow, sparkling against the night sky, the sign appears.</p><p>Stretched across the top of the gates, hidden in curls of iron, more firefly-like lights flicker to life. They pop as they brighten, some accompanied by a shower of glowing white sparks and a bit of smoke. The people nearest to the gates take a few steps back.</p><p>At first, it is only a random pattern of lights. But as more of them ignite, it becomes clear that they are aligned in scripted letters. First a <em>C</em> is distinguishable, followed by more letters. A <em>q</em>, oddly, and several <em>e’</em>s. When the final bulb pops alight, and the smoke and sparks dissipate, it is finally legible, this elaborate incandescent sign. Leaning to your left to gain a better view, you can see that it reads:</p><p class:\"”text-center”\"><em>Le Cirque des Rêves</em></p><p>Some in the crowd smile knowingly, while others frown and look questioningly at their neighbors. A child near you tugs on her mother’s sleeve, begging to know what it says.</p><p>“The Circus of Dreams,” comes the reply. The girl smiles delightedly.</p><p>Then the iron gates shudder and unlock, seemingly by their own volition. They swing outward, inviting the crowd inside.</p><p>Now the circus is open.</p><p>Now you may enter. </p>",

"passage" : "Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt have argued that experiencing awe—a sensation of reverence and wonder typically brought on by perceiving something grand or powerful—can enable us to feel more connected to others and thereby inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.",

        "passage": "Deserts, characterized by their extreme aridity, are defined by a delicate equilibrium between precipitation and evaporation, where water loss consistently surpasses water gain. To be classified as a desert, an area must receive less than 250 millimeters of average annual precipitation, a stark contrast to tropical rainforests, which can receive over 2,000 millimeters annually. The arid nature of deserts stems from various factors, including global atmospheric circulation patterns and rain shadow effects caused by mountain ranges. When precipitation does occur in desert regions, it often arrives in brief, intense bursts, leading to flash floods as the parched ground struggles to absorb the sudden influx of water. Deserts cover approximately one-third of Earth's land surface, making them a significant component of our planet's ecosystems and playing crucial roles in global climate regulation. While unified by their dryness, deserts exhibit remarkable diversity in temperature regimes and geographical locations. Hot deserts, typically found near the equator in subtropical regions, experience extremely high daytime temperatures exceeding 50°C during summer months. Examples include the Sahara in North Africa and the Sonoran in North America. Conversely, cold deserts, located in temperate regions often in the rain shadows of mountain ranges, experience greater temperature fluctuations, with summer highs reaching 38°C and winter lows plummeting to -40°C in extreme cases. The Gobi Desert in Asia and the Great Basin in North America exemplify this category. Polar deserts, found in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, represent another distinct type, rarely experiencing temperatures above freezing. One characteristic shared by all desert types is significant daily temperature fluctuation, a result of the lack of cloud cover and moisture in the air, which allows heat to escape rapidly after sunset. Contrary to popular belief, sandy deserts constitute only about 20% of the world's desert landscapes. Desert terrains exhibit incredible diversity, ranging from rocky mountains and high plateaus to gravel plains and salt flats. Mountain deserts, such as those found in the southwestern United States, feature rugged terrain with steep slopes and deep valleys, often resulting from tectonic activity and subsequent erosion. Plateau deserts, like the Colorado Plateau, are characterized by flat-topped mesas and buttes, sculpted over millennia by wind and water erosion. Despite its scarcity in deserts, water plays a crucial role in shaping the landscape. Sudden, intense storms carve ravines, gullies, and canyons into the terrain, eventually developing into spectacular formations like the Grand Canyon. Wind, another powerful force in desert environments, creates and shapes sand dunes in areas with loose sediment, while in rocky deserts, wind-blown sand acts like sandpaper, gradually wearing down exposed rock surfaces and creating unique formations such as mushroom rocks and ventifacts. Despite their challenging conditions, deserts support a surprising diversity of life, with plants and animals evolving remarkable adaptations to cope with extreme temperatures and water scarcity. Desert plants often exhibit modifications to conserve water and protect against intense sunlight. The saguaro cactus, native to the Sonoran Desert, exemplifies many of these adaptations with its thick, waxy skin, shallow, widespread root system, and distinctive pleated structure that enables water storage. Animals in desert ecosystems have also developed specialized traits for survival. Camels possess a range of adaptations, including the ability to go long periods without drinking, highly efficient kidneys that minimize water loss, and nostrils that can close to keep out blowing sand. Smaller desert animals, like kangaroo rats, have evolved to obtain all the water they need from the seeds they eat, never needing to drink free water. Many desert animals are nocturnal, becoming active only during the cooler nighttime hours to avoid intense daytime heat, conserve energy, and reduce water loss through evaporation. Humans have inhabited desert regions for millennia, developing ingenious methods to survive and even prosper in these harsh environments. Ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians along the Nile and the Nabataeans in Petra, created sophisticated water management systems to support agriculture and urban development in arid lands. In modern times, technology has enabled the growth of large cities in desert regions, with Las Vegas and Dubai serving as prime examples of how human ingenuity can transform barren landscapes into thriving metropolises. However, human activity in and around deserts has also contributed to desertification, the degradation of once-fertile land into desert. This phenomenon can occur through natural processes such as climate change but is often exacerbated by human activities like overgrazing, deforestation, and unsustainable water use. Currently, deserts cover approximately 33% of Earth's land surface, a percentage expected to increase due to ongoing climate change and human activities. Understanding and preserving desert ecosystems is crucial not only for the unique life forms they support but also for their role in global climate regulation and as potential sources of renewable energy. As we face the challenges of a changing climate, the lessons learned from Earth's arid realms may prove invaluable in adapting to an increasingly water-scarce world.",
