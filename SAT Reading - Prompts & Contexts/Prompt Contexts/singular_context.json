"passage" : "Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt have argued that experiencing awe—a sensation of reverence and wonder typically brought on by perceiving something grand or powerful—can enable us to feel more connected to others and thereby inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.",
"question" : "Which finding from the researchers’ study, if true, would most strongly support their claim?",
"correct_answer" : "Participants who had been looking at the trees helped the experimenter pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had been looking at the building.",
"distractors" : ["Participants who helped the experimenter pick up the pens used a greater number of positive words to describe the trees and the building in a postexperiment survey than did participants who did not help the experimenter.", "Participants who did not help the experimenter pick up the pens were significantly more likely to report having experienced a feeling of awe, regardless of whether they looked at the building or the trees.", "Participants who had been looking at the building were significantly more likely to notice that the experimenter had dropped the pens than were participants who had been looking at the trees."]},
"A":
{"score": 1, "reasoning": "There is only one objectively correct answer based on the information provided in the passage. The correct answer directly addresses the researchers' claim about awe inspiring altruistic behavior, which is the core of the question. Let's analyze each option:1. The correct answer states that participants who looked at the trees (awe-inspiring) helped pick up more pens than those who looked at the building (non-awe-inspiring). This directly supports the researchers' claim that experiencing awe can inspire more altruistic behavior.2. The first distractor focuses on positive word usage, which is not mentioned in the passage and does not directly relate to altruistic behavior.3. The second distractor suggests that those who didn't help experienced more awe, which contradicts the researchers' hypothesis and the study design described in the passage.4. The third distractor focuses on noticing the dropped pens, which is not relevant to the altruistic behavior of helping pick them up.The passage describes a study designed to test whether experiencing awe (by looking at tall trees) leads to more altruistic behavior (helping pick up spilled pens). The correct answer is the only option that directly addresses this relationship and would provide strong support for the researchers' claim if true. Therefore, there is only one objectively correct answer based on the information provided in the passage."}},

"passage" : "The Post Office is a 1912 play by Rabindranath Tagore, originally written in Bengali. The character Amal is a young boy who imagines that the people he sees passing the window of his home are carefree even when engaged in work or chores, as is evident when he says to the daughter of a flower seller, ______",
"question" : "Which quotation from The Post Office most effectively illustrates the claim?",
"correct_answer" : "“Oh, flower gathering? That is why your feet seem so glad and your anklets jingle so merrily as you walk.”",
"distractors" : ["“I see, you don’t wish to stop; I don’t care to stay on here either.”", "“I’ll pay when I grow up—before I leave to look for work out on the other side of that stream there.”", "“Wish I could be out too. Then I would pick some flowers for you from the very topmost branches right out of sight.”"]},
"A":
{  "score": 1,  "reasoning": "Based on the passage and the question, there is only one objectively correct answer. The passage states that Amal 'imagines that the people he sees passing the window of his home are carefree even when engaged in work or chores.' The question asks for a quotation that best illustrates this claim. The correct answer, 'Oh, flower gathering? That is why your feet seem so glad and your anklets jingle so merrily as you walk,' perfectly captures Amal's imagination of the flower seller's daughter being carefree and happy while engaged in work (flower gathering). This quote shows Amal interpreting the girl's movements as 'glad' and 'merry,' even though she's performing a task. None of the distractors illustrate Amal imagining others as carefree while working. The first distractor expresses a desire to leave, the second talks about future payment, and the third expresses a wish to be outside. These do not demonstrate Amal's perception of others being carefree during their tasks. Therefore, the correct answer is the only one that accurately responds to the question based on the information in the passage."}},

"passage" : "I remember the scent of acorn soup cooking and deer meat frying in quiet evenings of summer. And shivering under thin blankets in winter and watching the wall paper dance to the force of the winter winds outside. I remember the cry of an owl in the night and I knew it was an ominous warning, a cry of death. I remember running in the dust behind the medicine truck when it came to the reservation, lifesavers was a free treat. And grandpa sitting in his favorite resting chair under his favorite shade tree with his dog \"Oly\" by his side. I remember running naked and screaming with my aunt in hot pursuit, a stick in her hand, she always caught me. And every summer we would swim in the river and let the sun bake us until we were a shade less than purple, basking on the riverbank, undisturbed, at peace. And I remember grandma toiling in the bean fields while I played with my army truck on the fender of a \"49\" Plymouth. I remember going to the movies in town on Saturday nights with fifty cents in my pocket, thirty-five cents for the ticket and the rest was mine. Eating popcorn and drinking water from a discarded coke cup and rooting for the Indians to win, and they never did, but that was yesterday.",
"question" : "Based on the text, how does the author perceive his environment during his childhood?",
"correct_answer" : "The author perceives his environment as a blend of natural beauty and cultural significance.",
"distractors" : ["The author perceives his environment as simple and unremarkable, focusing on everyday life.", "The author perceives his environment as isolated and foreboding, marked by ominous signs.", "The author perceives his environment with a sense of nostalgia and longing for the past."]},
"A":
{  "score": 0,  "reasoning": "After careful analysis, I believe there is not only one objectively correct answer based solely on the information provided in the passage. While the correct answer, 'The author perceives his environment as a blend of natural beauty and cultural significance,' is supported by the passage, it is not the only valid interpretation. Here's why:1. The correct answer is partially supported by the passage. The author does mention natural elements (e.g., 'scent of acorn soup,' 'cry of an owl,' 'swimming in the river') and cultural aspects (e.g., 'medicine truck,' 'grandma toiling in the bean fields,' 'going to the movies').2. However, one of the distractors, 'The author perceives his environment with a sense of nostalgia and longing for the past,' is more strongly supported by the passage. The entire text is written in a nostalgic tone, using phrases like 'I remember' repeatedly, and ending with 'but that was yesterday,' clearly indicating a longing for the past. Given that a distractor can be better supported by the text, it's difficult to assert that there is only one objectively correct answer."}},

"A":
{  "score": 0,  "reasoning": "After careful analysis, I cannot conclude that there is only one objectively correct answer to this question based on the given passage. While the provided correct answer, 'Widen the crannies, / Shoulder through holes,' does indeed support the idea of mushrooms' subtle yet inevitable influence, at least one of the distractors could also be considered a valid answer. Specifically, the distractor 'Our kind multiplies: / We shall by morning / Inherit the earth' also strongly supports the notion of mushrooms' inevitable influence. This line suggests a rapid and widespread growth that will lead to dominance, which aligns with the question's focus on 'subtle yet inevitable influence.' Additionally, the distractor 'Soft fists insist on / Heaving the needles, / The leafy bedding, / Even the paving' could also be interpreted as supporting the subtle yet persistent nature of mushroom growth. The poem uses various metaphors and imagery to describe the growth and spread of mushrooms, making it difficult to definitively state that one particular line best supports the author's view on their influence. While the given correct answer is certainly a valid choice, it cannot be considered the only objectively correct answer based solely on the information provided in the passage."}},

"passage" : "NASA’s Aspera mission, led by Carlos Vargas, will investigate the circumgalactic medium (CGM), the huge swaths of low-density gas that fill and surround galaxies. Specifically, the team will focus on portions of the gas that exist in a “warm-hot” phase: these portions haven’t previously been observable but are thought to fuel new star formation and hold most of the mass that makes up a galaxy. Using a telescope capable of revealing these parts of the CGM, the Aspera mission should help answer long-standing questions about how galaxies emerge, change, and even interact.",

The correct answer accurately summarizes the main idea of the text, while the distractors contain information that is either not supported by the passage or does not capture the main idea. The correct answer states that 'The Aspera mission is expected to produce the first direct observations of CGM gas in the \"warm-hot\" phase, which likely has an important role in the evolution of galaxies.' This is fully supported by the passage, which mentions that the Aspera mission will investigate the CGM, focusing on the 'warm-hot' phase that 'haven't previously been observable' and is 'thought to fuel new star formation and hold most of the mass that makes up a galaxy.' The passage also states that this mission 'should help answer long-standing questions about how galaxies emerge, change, and even interact.' Examining the distractors: The passage does not state that Vargas will be the first person to investigate the CGM, only that he leads the mission. While this distractor contains some correct information, it does not capture the main idea of the text, which is about the Aspera mission's goals and potential impact. This distractor mentions galaxy evolution and interaction, but it does not capture the main focus of the passage, which is the Aspera mission's specific goals regarding the CGM.

"A":
{  "score": 0,  "reasoning": "After careful analysis, I conclude that there isn't only one objectively correct answer based on the information provided in the passage. Here's why:1. The correct answer states that the passage 'illustrate[s] the difficult moral choices people face in extreme situations.' However, the passage doesn't explicitly mention moral choices. It describes a situation of economic disparity and growing anger, but doesn't delve into moral dilemmas faced by individuals.2. One of the distractors, 'highlight the economic disparity between the rich and the poor,' actually seems to be a more accurate interpretation of the passage's primary purpose. The passage contrasts 'full granaries' with 'starving men' and 'children of the poor,' clearly illustrating economic inequality.3. The passage emphasizes the tension between abundance and poverty, and the growing anger resulting from this disparity. It mentions that 'money that might have gone for wages went for gas, for guns, for agents and spies, for blacklists, for drilling,' which further supports the theme of economic inequality.4. While the other distractors are less relevant, the presence of a potentially more accurate answer than the one provided as 'correct' means we cannot confidently say there is only one objectively correct answer.Given these points, particularly the strong argument for the distractor about economic disparity, we cannot conclude that there is only one objectively correct answer based solely on the information in the passage."}},
