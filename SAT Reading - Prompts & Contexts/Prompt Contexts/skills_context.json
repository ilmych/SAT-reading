Under the long shaggy ridges, she felt the future stirring.”\n\n“Alexandra talked to the men about their crops and to the women about their poultry. She spent a whole day with one young farmer who had been away at school, and who was experimenting with a new kind of clover hay. She learned a great deal.”\n\n“Alexandra drove off alone. The rattle of her wagon was lost in the howling of the wind, but her lantern, held firmly between her feet, made a moving point of light along the highway, going deeper and deeper into the dark country.”\n\n“It was Alexandra who read the papers and followed the markets, and who learned by the mistakes of their neighbors.

    "sample_question3": "Many insects are iridescent, or have colors that appear to shimmer and change when seen from different angles. Scientists have assumed that this feature helps to attract mates but could also attract predators. But biologist Karin Kjernsmo and a team had the idea that the shifting appearance of colors might actually make it harder for other animals to see iridescent insects. To test this idea, the team put beetle forewings on leaves along a forest path and then asked human participants to look for them. Some of the wings were naturally iridescent. Others were painted with a nonchanging color from the iridescent spectrum, such as purple or blue.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support the team’s idea?\n\nOn average, participants found most of the purple wings and blue wings and far fewer of the iridescent wings.\n\nOn average, participants found the iridescent wings faster than they found the purple wings or blue wings.\n\nSome participants reported that the purple wings were easier to see than the blue wings.\n\nSome participants successfully found all of the wings on the leaves."

Ice with air bubbles trapped in it looks white because much of the light reflects off the bubbles. Ice without air bubbles usually looks blue because the light travels deep into the ice and only a little of it is reflected. However, some icebergs in the sea around Antarctica appear to be green.

    "sample_question3": "The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a band of clouds that encircles Earth in the tropics and is a major rainfall source, shifts position in response to temperature variations across Earth’s hemispheres. Data from Huagapo Cave in Peru suggest the ITCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age (circa 1300–1850), but a shift as far into South America as Huagapo should have led to dry conditions in Central America, which is inconsistent with climate models. To resolve the issue, geologist Yemane Asmerom and colleagues collected data from Yok Balum Cave in Central America and compared them with the Huagapo data. They concluded that during the Little Ice Age, the ITCZ may have expanded northward and southward rather than simply shifted.\n\nWhich finding from Asmerom and colleagues’ study, if true, would most directly support their conclusion? \n\nNeither the Yok Balum data nor the Huagapo data show significant local variations in temperature during the Little Ice Age. \n\nBoth the Yok Balum data and the Huagapo data show increased temperatures and prolonged dry conditions during the Little Ice Age. \n\nThe Yok Balum data show prolonged dry conditions during the same portions of the Little Ice Age in which the Huagapo data show heightened levels of rainfall. \n\nThe Yok Balum data and the Huagapo data show strongly correlated patterns of high rainfall during the Little Ice Age."

    "sample_question2": "Text 1\nLiterary scholars have struggled with the vastness of Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka’s collective works of drama (spanning over 20 plays in total). It is best, however, to understand Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist chronologically. Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards. \n\nText 2 \nIt is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka’s plays to fit neatly into three phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka’s work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount significant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time. \n\nWhich choice best describes a difference in how the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 view the study of Soyinka’s works of drama?\n\nWhile the author of Text 1 believes that thinking about Soyinka’s works of theater in phases is useful, the author of Text 2 views such an approach as limiting.\n\nAlthough the author of Text 1 claims that Soyinka’s style as a dramatist has evolved over time, the author of Text 2 argues that Soyinka’s style has remained consistent throughout his career.\n\nThe author of Text 1 considers Soyinka’s plays to showcase his strongest writing, whereas the author of Text 2 believes that Soyinka’s poetry is where he is most skilled.\n\nThe author of Text 1 argues that Soyinka’s early plays were his most politically charged, whereas the author of Text 2 claims that Soyinka’s most recent plays are the most politicized.",
    "sample_question3": "Text 1\nItalian painters in the 1500s rarely depicted themselves in their work. Even more rare were self-portrait paintings that portrayed the artist as a painter. At the time, painting was not yet respected as a profession, so painters mostly chose to emphasize other qualities in their self-portraits, like their intellect or social status. <u>In the city of Bologna, the first artist to depict themself painting was a man named Annibale Carracci.</u> A painting of his from around 1585 shows Carracci in front of an easel holding a palette. \n\nText 2\nIn their self-portraits, Bolognese artists typically avoided referring to the act of painting until the mid-1600s. However, Lavinia Fontana’s 1577 painting, Self-Portrait at the Keyboard, stands out as the earliest example of such a work by an artist from Bologna. Although the artist is depicted playing music, in the background, one can spot a painting easel by a window.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?\n\nCarracci and Fontana were among the most well-respected painters in Bologna at the time.\n\nThe depiction of Fontana in Self-Portrait at the Keyboard was intended to underscore the artist’s creativity.\n\nFontana likely inspired the reference to an easel and palette in Carracci’s painting.\n\nSelf-Portrait at the Keyboard was painted earlier than Carracci’s painting and also refers to the artist’s craft."

The O. khaungraae fossil consists of a rounded skull with a thin snout and a large eye socket. Because these features look like they are avian, or related to birds, researchers initially thought that the fossil might be the smallest avian dinosaur ever found.\n\nText 2\nPaleontologists were excited to discover a second small fossil that is similar to the strange O. khaungraae fossil but has part of the lower body along with a birdlike skull. Detailed studies of both fossils revealed several traits that are found in lizards but not in dinosaurs or birds. Therefore, paleontologists think the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls looked avian at first.\n\nBased on the texts, what would the paleontologists in Text 2 most likely say about the researchers’ initial thought in Text 1?\n\nIt is understandable because the fossil does look like it could be related to birds, even though O. khaungraae is probably a lizard.\n\nIt is confusing because it isn’t clear what caused the researchers to think that O. khaungraae might be related to birds.\n\nIt is flawed because the researchers mistakenly assumed that O. khaungraae must be a lizard.\n\nIt is reasonable because the O. khaungraae skull is about the same size as the skull of the second fossil but is shaped differently.",
    "sample_question2": "Text 1\nBecause literacy in Nahuatl script, the writing system of the Aztec Empire, was lost after Spain invaded central Mexico in the 1500s, it is unclear exactly how meaning was encoded in the script’s symbols. Although many scholars had assumed that the symbols signified entire words, linguist Alfonso Lacadena theorized in 2008 that they signified units of language smaller than words: individual syllables.\n\nText 2\nThe growing consensus among scholars of Nahuatl script is that many of its symbols could signify either words or syllables, depending on syntax and content at any given site within a text. For example, the symbol signifying the word huipil (blouse) in some contexts could signify the syllable “pil” in others, as in the place name “Chipiltepec.” Thus, for the Aztecs, reading required a determination of how such symbols functioned each time they appeared in a text.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely characterize Lacadena’s theory, as described in Text 1?\n\nBy praising the theory for recognizing that the script’s symbols could represent entire words\n\nBy arguing that the theory is overly influenced by the work of earlier scholars \n\nBy approving of the theory’s emphasis on how the script changed over time\n\nBy cautioning that the theory overlooks certain important aspects of how the script functioned",

In addition to knowing the fundamentals of art, digital artists need to be familiar with sophisticated software. Many artists will start by drawing an image on paper before transforming the piece to a digital format, where they can apply a variety of colors and techniques that would otherwise require many different traditional tools.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claims of the author of Text 1? \n\nBy arguing that a piece of art created digitally can still be displayed traditionally\n\nBy explaining that it’s actually much harder to use a tablet and stylus to create art than to use paint and a brush\n\nBy insisting that digital art requires artistic abilities and skill even if it employs less traditional tools\n\nBy admitting that most digital artists don’t think fundamental drawing skills are important"
