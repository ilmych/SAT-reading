"passage" : "Algae living within the tissues of corals play a critical role in keeping corals, and the marine ecosystems they are part of, thriving. Some coral species appear brown in color when healthy due to the algae colonies living in their tissues. In the event of an environmental stressor, the algae can die or be expelled, causing the corals to appear white. To recover the algae, the bleached corals then begin to produce bright colors, which block intense sunlight, encouraging the light-sensitive algae to recolonize the corals.",
"question" : "What does the text most strongly suggest about corals that produce bright colors?",
"distractor" : "These corals are likely more vulnerable to exposure from intense sunlight than white corals are."},
"A":
{"score": 1, "reasoning": "The distractor cannot be easily eliminated without carefully reading the passage. It is directly related to the topic of the question, which asks about corals producing bright colors. The distractor suggests a potential vulnerability to sunlight, which is not immediately contradictory to the idea of corals producing bright colors. To determine if this statement is incorrect, one needs to carefully read the passage to understand the relationship between bright colors, sunlight, and coral health. The passage actually states that bright colors block intense sunlight, which contradicts the distractor, but this information is not obvious without a thorough reading."}},

"passage" : "This passage is from Suparna Choudhury, “Culturing the Adolescent Brain: What Can Neuroscience Learn from Anthropology?” in Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 2010. “Cross-cultural researchers stress that the meanings of developmental tasks associated with adolescence such as the establishment of independence or autonomy may differ according to culture, and may be subject to change over time. For example, developing independence in some cultures may mean taking on duties to care for siblings or elders, and not necessarily separating from adults and orienting towards peers. Based on a study comparing five cultures that could be contrasted as ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ or ‘collectivistic’ and ‘individualistic,’ Trommsdorff suggested that ‘turbulent’ features such as intergenerational conflict stem from the focus on attaining independence from parents during this period and are linked to cultural values of individualism in Western societies.”",
"question" : "The author's description of the differences in adolescent experiences across cultures serves primarily to",
"distractor" : "suggest that adolescence is a universally challenging period across all cultures."},
"A":
{"score": 0, "reasoning": "The question itself mentions ‘differences in adolescent experiences across cultures’, indicating that ‘universally challenging’ cannot be true. This distractor contradicts the question and can, therefore, be eliminated without careful consideration"}},

"passage" : "Dear Mr. Brown: I have been instructed by our central office in Columbia to advise you that the Forestry Commission is not empowered with the authority to grant your permission to visit Edisto Beach State Park. This park was established in 1935 for the exclusive use of white persons, and based on custom and precedence we will have to deny your request. Several of the state parks in South Carolina are designated for Negro use only. One park in this area, Hunting Island, has separate areas for whites and Negroes. I suggest that you visit that park where you will be most welcome. If you have any questions pertaining to the above, please contact our Columbia office direct. This correct name and address is: S.C. State Commission of Forestry P.O. Box 357 Columbia, S.C. Yours very truly, Donald B. Cooler, Supt. Edisto Beach State Park Edisto Island, S.C.",
"question" : "What underlying societal issue does the letter from Donald B. Cooler highlight?",
"distractor" : "Religious intolerance."},
"A":
{"score": 1, "reasoning": "The distractor 'Religious intolerance' cannot be immediately eliminated without carefully reading the passage. The question asks about an underlying societal issue, which could potentially include religious intolerance. While the passage primarily discusses racial segregation, without a careful reading, one cannot definitively rule out that religious intolerance might also be mentioned or implied as a secondary issue. The distractor is not unrelated to the concept of societal issues, doesn't contradict the question, and isn't grammatically inconsistent. A thorough reading of the passage is necessary to determine that religious intolerance is not the main societal issue being highlighted."}},

"passage" : "Charles “Teenie” Harris was a photographer for the Pittsburgh Courier from 1936 to 1975. During his career he took over 70,000 photographs documenting everyday life in Pittsburgh’s Black communities. The Carnegie Museum of Art maintains thousands of his photographs, carefully ______blank them so that audiences can continue to view them well into the future.",
"question" : "Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?",
"distractor" : "replacing"},
"A":
{"score": 1, "reasoning": "The distractor 'replacing' cannot be immediately eliminated without carefully reading the passage. It's related to the topic of preserving photographs, which is mentioned in the question. The word 'replacing' could potentially fit in the blank, as it's not grammatically inconsistent and doesn't contain any obvious factual errors. To determine if 'replacing' is incorrect, one would need to carefully read the passage to understand the context and the museum's actions regarding the photographs. Only by understanding the full context can we determine if 'replacing' is an appropriate or inappropriate word choice."}},

"question" : "\"This park was established for the exclusive use of certain individuals, and based on tradition we will have to deny your request.\" Which choice best describes the function of this sentence in the overall structure of the text?",
"distractor" : "It suggests alternative parks that Mr. Brown can visit."},
"A":
{"score": 0, "reasoning": "The distractor can be eliminated without carefully reading the passage. The question asks about the function of a sentence that explicitly states the park's exclusivity and the denial of the request. The distractor, on the other hand, talks about suggesting alternative parks. These are clearly distinct functions within the text."}},

"passage" : "Every summer, millions of children across the country face a pervasive challenge: hunger. During the school year, many of these children rely on free or reduced-price meals provided by their schools. However, when summer vacation begins, this crucial support system disappears, leaving a significant gap in their nutrition. The impact of this seasonal hunger is far-reaching, affecting not only the physical health of these children but also their ability to engage in summer learning and activities. Community organizations and volunteers work tirelessly to bridge this gap, but the problem remains pervasive, demanding more comprehensive solutions.",
"question" : "As used in the text, what does the word pervasive most nearly mean?",
"distractor" : "Localized"},
"A":{
"score": 0, "reasoning": "The distractor 'Localized' can be eliminated without carefully reading the passage. The question asks about the meaning of 'pervasive' in the text, and 'localized' is essentially the opposite of 'pervasive'. Even without reading the passage, one can deduce that 'localized' is unlikely to be the correct answer for a word that means 'pervasive'. Additionally, the passage begins by mentioning 'millions of children across the country', which quickly indicates that the issue being discussed is widespread, not localized. A brief skim of the passage would confirm this, making it easy to eliminate this distractor."}}
