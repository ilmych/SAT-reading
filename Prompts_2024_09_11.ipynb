Each approach has advantages over the other. In wild studies, researchers can more easily presume that the animals are behaving normally, and in lab studies, researchers can more easily control factors that might affect the results. But if, for example, the results from a wild study and a lab study of Western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) contradict each other, one or both of the studies must have failed to account for some factor that was relevant to the birds’ behavior. Which choice best states the main idea of the text? A) When the results of a natural-habitat study and those from a lab study of a wild animal such as the Western scrub-jay conflict, the study in the natural habitat is more likely than the lab study to have accurate results. B) Studying wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay in both their natural habitat and lab settings is likely to yield conflicting results that researchers cannot fully resolve. C) Wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay can be effectively studied in their natural habitat and in the lab, but each approach has drawbacks that could affect the accuracy of the findings. D) Differing results between natural-habitat and lab studies of wild animals such as the Western scrub-jay are a strong indication that both of the studies had design flaws that affected the accuracy of their results.\",\n",

Some coral species appear brown in color when healthy due to the algae colonies living in their tissues. In the event of an environmental stressor, the algae can die or be expelled, causing the corals to appear white. To recover the algae, the bleached corals then begin to produce bright colors, which block intense sunlight, encouraging the light-sensitive algae to recolonize the corals. What does the text most strongly suggest about corals that produce bright colors? A) These corals have likely been subjected to stressful environmental conditions. B) These corals are likely more vulnerable to exposure from intense sunlight than white corals are. C) These corals have likely recovered from an environmental event without the assistance of algae colonies. D) These corals are more likely to survive without algae colonies than brown corals are.\",\n",
        "    \"sample_question2\": \"Disco remains one of the most ridiculed popular music genres of the late twentieth century. But as scholars have argued, the genre is far less superficial than many people believe. Take the case of disco icon Donna Summer: she may have been associated with popular songs about love and heartbreak (subjects hardly unique to disco, by the way), but like many Black women singers before her, much of her music also reflects concerns about community and identity. These concerns are present in many of the genre’s greatest songs, and they generally don’t require much digging to reveal. What does the text most strongly suggest about the disco genre? A) It has been unjustly ignored by most scholars despite the importance of the themes addressed by many of the genre’s songs. B) It evolved over time from a superficial genre focused on romance to a genre focused on more serious concerns. C) It has been unfairly dismissed for the inclusion of subject matter that is also found in other musical genres. D) It gave rise to a Black women’s musical tradition that has endured even though the genre itself faded in the late twentieth century.\",\n",

Audience members, who wander through the labyrinthine venue at their own pace and follow the actors as they play out simultaneous, interweaving narrative loops, confront the impossibility of experiencing the production in its entirety. The play’s refusal of narrative coherence thus hinges on the sense of spatial fragmentation that the venue’s immense and intricate layout generates. What does the text most strongly suggest about Sleep No More’s use of its performance space?  A) The choice of a New York City venue likely enabled the play’s creators to experiment with the use of theatrical space in a way that venues from earlier productions could not. B) Audience members likely find the experience of the play disappointing because they generally cannot make their way through the entire venue. C) The production’s dependence on a particular performance environment would likely make it difficult to reproduce exactly in a different theatrical space. D) Audience members who navigate the space according to a recommended itinerary will likely have a better grasp of the play’s narrative than audience members who depart from that itinerary.\"\n",

Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building.

In wild studies, researchers can more easily presume that the animals are behaving normally, and in lab studies, researchers can more easily control factors that might affect the results. But if, for example, the results from a wild study and a lab study of Western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) contradict each other, one or both of the studies must have failed to account for some factor that was relevant to the birds' behavior.\\n\\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?\",\n",

He found that feathers of high-elevation species not only have a greater proportion of warming downy sections to flat and smooth sections than do feathers of low-elevation species, but high-elevation species' feathers also tend to be longer, providing a thicker layer of insulation.

No color at all, save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the surrounding fields. Black-and-white stripes on grey sky; countless tents of varying shapes and sizes, with an elaborate wrought-iron fence encasing them in a colorless world. Even what little ground is visible from outside is black or white, painted or powdered, or treated with some other circus trick.</p><p>But it is not open for business. Not just yet.</p><p>Within hours everyone in town has heard about it. By afternoon news has spread several towns over. Word of mouth is a more effective method of advertisement than typeset words and exclamation points on paper pamphlets or posters. It is impressive and unusual news, the sudden appearance of a mysterious circus. People marvel at the staggering height of the tallest tents. They stare at the clock that sits just inside the gates that no one can properly describe.</p><p>And the black sign painted in white letters that hangs upon the gates, the one that reads:</p><p class=\\\"”text-center”\\\"><em>Opens at Nightfall<br/>Closes at Dawn</em></p><p>“What kind of circus is only open at night?” people ask. No one has a proper answer, yet as dusk approaches there is a substantial crowd of spectators gathering outside the gates.</p><p>You are amongst them, of course. Your curiosity got the better of you, as curiosity is wont to do. You stand in the fading light, the scarf around your neck pulled up against the chilly evening breeze, waiting to see for yourself exactly what kind of circus only opens once the sun sets.</p><p>The ticket booth clearly visible behind the gates is closed and barred. The tents are still, save for when they ripple ever so slightly in the wind. The only movement within the circus is the clock that ticks by the passing minutes, if such a wonder of sculpture can even be called a clock.</p><p>The circus looks abandoned and empty. But you think perhaps you can smell caramel wafting through the evening breeze, beneath the crisp scent of the autumn leaves. A subtle sweetness at the edges of the cold.</p><p>The sun disappears completely beyond the horizon, and the remaining luminosity shifts from dusk to twilight. The people around you are growing restless from waiting, a sea of shuffling feet, murmuring about abandoning the endeavor in search of someplace warmer to pass the evening. You yourself are debating departing when it happens.</p><p>First, there is a popping sound. It is barely audible over the wind and conversation. A soft noise like a kettle about to boil for tea. Then comes the light.</p><p>All over the tents, small lights begin to flicker, as though the entirety of the circus is covered in particularly bright fireflies. The waiting crowd quiets as it watches this display of illumination. Someone near you gasps. A small child claps his hands with glee at the sight.</p><p>When the tents are all aglow, sparkling against the night sky, the sign appears.</p><p>Stretched across the top of the gates, hidden in curls of iron, more firefly-like lights flicker to life. They pop as they brighten, some accompanied by a shower of glowing white sparks and a bit of smoke. The people nearest to the gates take a few steps back.</p><p>At first, it is only a random pattern of lights. But as more of them ignite, it becomes clear that they are aligned in scripted letters. First a <em>C</em> is distinguishable, followed by more letters. A <em>q</em>, oddly, and several <em>e’</em>s. When the final bulb pops alight, and the smoke and sparks dissipate, it is finally legible, this elaborate incandescent sign. Leaning to your left to gain a better view, you can see that it reads:</p><p class=\\\"”text-center”\\\"><em>Le Cirque des Rêves</em></p><p>Some in the crowd smile knowingly, while others frown and look questioningly at their neighbors. A child near you tugs on her mother’s sleeve, begging to know what it says.</p><p>“The Circus of Dreams,” comes the reply. The girl smiles delightedly.</p><p>Then the iron gates shudder and unlock, seemingly by their own volition. They swing outward, inviting the crowd inside.</p><p>Now the circus is open.</p><p>Now you may enter. </p>\"\n",

Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.\"\n",

The passage states that Amal \\'imagines that the people he sees passing the window of his home are carefree even when engaged in work or chores.\\' The question asks for a quotation that best illustrates this claim. The correct answer, \\'Oh, flower gathering? That is why your feet seem so glad and your anklets jingle so merrily as you walk,\\' perfectly captures Amal\\'s imagination of the flower seller\\'s daughter being carefree and happy while engaged in work (flower gathering). This quote shows Amal interpreting the girl\\'s movements as \\'glad\\' and \\'merry,\\' even though she\\'s performing a task. None of the distractors illustrate Amal imagining others as carefree while working. The first distractor expresses a desire to leave, the second talks about future payment, and the third expresses a wish to be outside.

The correct answer states that 'The Aspera mission is expected to produce the first direct observations of CGM gas in the \"warm-hot\" phase, which likely has an important role in the evolution of galaxies.' This is fully supported by the passage, which mentions that the Aspera mission will investigate the CGM, focusing on the 'warm-hot' phase that 'haven't previously been observable' and is 'thought to fuel new star formation and hold most of the mass that makes up a galaxy.' The passage also states that this mission 'should help answer long-standing questions about how galaxies emerge, change, and even interact.' Examining the distractors: The passage does not state that Vargas will be the first person to investigate the CGM, only that he leads the mission.
